    wants to terminate during parsing, either because an error occurred or
    because an action that bails out early was triggered, like "help".

    In `argparse.ArgumentParser`, early exit is accomplished by calling
    `sys.exit`, which raises a `SystemExit` error.

    This behavior has been changed in Clavier because:

    1.  We want the ability to do something other than exit the process, such as
        when we're in a `clavier.embed` loop.

    2.  We want to be able to distinguish between exceptions that came from
        `clavier.arg_par.ArgumentParser.exit` and some `sys.exit` call in user
        code.

    3.  Much the same as deciding how and when to exit the process, we want to
        handle printing of messages and feedback at a higher level.
